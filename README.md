# VoiceControlledCar

This is code for building a voice-controlled autonomous driving car. Machine learning techniques such as PCA clustering were used for the voice control while discrete control/feedback loops were used to control the wheels. To build the car, I mounted an Arduino and breadboard on top of the car, on which I built the circuitry/hardware.
